Virtual environment : an extremely useful tool to help keep your coding environment tidy on your computer. It's possible to skip this step, 
                      but it's highly recommended. Starting with the best possible setup will save you a lot of trouble in the future!


To create a new virtualenv, use the below command in the command prompt

python -m venv myvenv

Where myvenv is the name of your virtualenv. You can use any other name, but stick to lowercase and use no spaces, 

accents or special characters. It is also good idea to keep the name short â€“ you'll be referencing it a lot!

Working with virtualenv

The command above will create a directory called myvenv (or whatever name you chose) that contains our virtual environment (basically a bunch of directory and files).

Start your virtual environment by running:

D:\django\inventateq>myvenv\Scripts\activate

NOTE: on Windows 10 you might get an error in the Windows PowerShell that says execution of scripts is disabled on this system. In this case, open another 

Windows PowerShell with the "Run as Administrator" option. Then try typing the following command before starting your virtual environment:

C:\WINDOWS\system32> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    Execution Policy Change
    The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks 
    described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?

You will know that you have virtualenv started when you see that the prompt in your console is prefixed with (myvenv).
    
(myvenv) D:\django\inventateq>   

now we will install django

get the latest pip using the below command. pip is tool which allows you to install all the third party tools.

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
